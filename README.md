# CPSC 330 2024W1 hw5

CPSC 330 Mini-project in python.  Using a dataset of New York Airbnb Listings from 2017, alongside the 15 different column variable types, we will create a regression model to predict the number of `reviews_per_month` a given airbnb will recieve given these variable and compare it to the baseline model.  In our project, we will utilize the inclusion of different models, pipeline creation, feature engineering, feature selection, hyperparameter optimization, and SHAP plots; we can then provide interpretations for each individual feature and results of our model.  In this project, we have discovered the RandomForestRegressor to provide the best model and testing our model on unseen data, we have recieved a coefficient of determination **R^2** = 0.697.
